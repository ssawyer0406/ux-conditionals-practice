/*
Exercise One

Is it larger than 10?
*/

let number = 5;

// 1. Create an if statement where the number is greater than 10.
// If it is, then log "It is bigger than 10!" using console.log().

// 2. Change the number variable to something larger than 10, run your code and
// make sure it works.

Exercise Two

Determining a color
*/

let color = "";
// 1. Pick either "blue", "red", or "green" and assign it to the color variable.

// 2. Create an if statement, if the color is "blue", then log "The sky is blue." using console.log

// 3. Create an else if statement, and if the color is "red" then log "The flower is red."

// 4. create another else if statement where if the color is "green" then log "The Leaf is green."

// 5. Finally, create an else statement and log "It is a different color".

// 6. Test your code! Change the value of the color variable to different colors and run your code.
// The correct message should log to the console.

Exercise Three

Create conditional statements to create the following results.

If the number is greater than 10, and the number is less than 20, then print "Between 10 and 20!"
If the number is greater than or equal to 20, then print "20 or greater!"
If the number is exactly 16, then print "16!"
If the number is less than or equal to 10, print "10 or less!";

Hint: You may need to rearrange your conditions to make this easy!
A good practice is to take the most restrictive condition and check it first (like 16),
then work your way to the most broad condition ("Some other number").

Hint Two: You can either do this with nested if statements, or you can do it with 
a chain of if else statements, some of those just might need multible conditions (like: if (a && b) )
